Some thoughts on software development.

My name is Ryan Sadler and I'm a Staff Software Engineer at Reddit.  You can find me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansadler/).

I've worked as a software developer for over 20 years now.  Coding was always a hobby of mine.  My
first computer was a Commodore Vic20, with 3KB of RAM.  It was simple enough I could figure it out
how it worked at the hardware level. The manual that came with the computer was complete with schematics.

These days I like to code in Rust and Python.  My latest project is a hotreloadable ELF linker.
More details will hopefully find their way onto the blog.
