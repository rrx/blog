My name is Ryan Sadler and I'm a Staff Software Engineer at Gretel.  You can find me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansadler/). This is a blog of my thoughts on software development.

I've worked as a software developer for over 20 years now.  Coding has always been a hobby of mine.  My
first computer was a Commodore Vic20, with 3KB of RAM.  It was simple enough that could understand
how it worked at the hardware level. The manual that came with the computer came complete with schematics for the motherboard.  Things have gotten a lot more complicated since then.

These days I like to code in Rust and Python.  My latest project is a hotreloadable ELF linker.
More details will hopefully find their way to the blog.
