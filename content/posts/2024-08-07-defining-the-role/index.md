# Defining the Role of a Staff Software Developer

The role of a staff software developer is one of the most fluid and variable positions within a tech organization. Unlike more junior roles, where responsibilities are clearly defined and outcomes are straightforward, the expectations for a staff developer can often be nebulous. Each company has its unique culture, structure, and needs, which means that what is expected of a staff developer at one organization can be quite different from another.

A staff developer is often seen through idealized caricatures—the hero coder who can solve any problem single-handedly, the strategic thinker who can align technology with business goals, or the mentor who shapes the next generation of developers. While these images can be informative, they are also unrealistic and inaccurate in isolation. The true value a staff developer brings depends entirely on how well they adapt to their specific company’s context and needs.

Given the vague nature of this role, it’s crucial for a staff developer to take proactive steps to align their skills and contributions with specific company needs. This starts by turning nebulous expectations into concrete actions. This is especially important for new staff developer hires, who are often faced with a completely new landscape, challenging their assumptions about the role and forcing them to level up their skills and influence. This process involves continuous dialogue with managers to ensure alignment on what success looks like.

Without this alignment, there is a risk of misunderstanding the role, leading to a breakdown in trust or, worse, dismissal for non-performance, despite strong performance in other areas. It is the full responsibility of the staff developer to bridge the gap between an ambiguously defined role and the behaviors and actions that define a successful staff engineer in those specific circumstances. Circumstances can even change within a company, depending on the specific team or division. Regular check-ins with managers can help clarify expectations and ensure that both parties are on the same page. Being proactive in seeking feedback can avoid problems later.

Proactively defining your role as a staff developer allows you to drive the conversation in a way that works for you, either towards your strengths or to building your skills. Don’t let the ambiguity deter you. Pretending those expectations don’t exist sets you up for surprises later on.

Here are a few ideas:

1. **Engage in Continuous Dialogue:** Regularly communicate with your managers to clarify expectations and success metrics. Define some goals early and check in to see how things are going.
2. **Seek Feedback Proactively:** Don’t wait for annual reviews; ask for feedback often to stay aligned. Feedback can come from all over, not just from your manager.
3. **Identify Company Goals:** Find the company's pain points and their critical objectives. Channel your ideas and activity towards solving those goals, even if they seem out of reach.
4. **Raise the Bar:** You can spend a year or two understanding all of the decisions that came before. It's good to understand these things, but it's more important to be the one setting a high standard and moving your team in that direction. A fresh perspective can help challenge unquestioned assumptions.
5. **Adapt and Evolve:** Be prepared to adapt your role as company needs and team dynamics change. If you expect the change, you won't be caught off guard.
6. **Mentorship and Networking:** Seek mentorship and build a network to gain insights and advice on navigating the nuances of your role that may be specific to the company. You will find that others in the company are already thinking about many of the problems that need to be solved.
7. **Listen to Leadership:** Executives often provide great direction and are a great source of ideas. It can be easy to tune them out after a while, but keep checking in, or you may find yourself out of sync. Turning their ideas into a reality is part of your job.

By proactively defining your role as a staff developer, you can drive the conversation in a way that works for you, either towards your strengths or towards building your skills. Don’t let the ambiguity deter you. Pretending those expectations don’t exist sets you up for surprises later on.
